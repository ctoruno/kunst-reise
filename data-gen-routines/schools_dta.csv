0,"The Renaissance was a pivotal period in European history, marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. It began in Italy in the late 14th century and spread across Europe over the next two centuries. This era was characterized by a revival of interest in the classical art and learning of Ancient Greece and Rome. The movement was fueled by a renewed emphasis on humanism, the belief in the potential value and goodness of human beings, a dramatic shift from medieval thinking. Socially, the rediscovery of classical texts and the invention of the printing press facilitated the spread of knowledge. Politically, the rise of powerful city-states like Florence, Venice, and Milan provided economic support and patronage. Leaders such as the Medici family in Florence were major patrons of the arts. Culturally, the Renaissance saw advances in fields as diverse as science, exploration, and philosophy, all of which influenced artistic expression.",1400 to 1600,"Renaissance art is characterized by its focus on realism, perspective, and individualism. Artists introduced linear perspective, creating the illusion of depth and space. There was a strong emphasis on proportion, anatomy, and naturalism, with a focus on portraying the human body accurately. This period also saw a dramatic increase in the use of light and shadow, or chiaroscuro, to give volume and three-dimensionality to forms. Renaissance artists drew inspiration from classical antiquity but also innovated, employing techniques such as fresco and oil painting. The subject matter often included religious themes, but with a more human-centered perspective, alongside increased interest in secular themes and classical mythology. Philosophically, the Renaissance celebrated human potential and achievement, reflecting the values of humanism.","['Leonardo da Vinci', 'Michelangelo Buonarroti', 'Raphael', 'Titian', 'Sandro Botticelli', 'Albrecht Dürer', 'Donatello', 'Giovanni Bellini', 'Giorgione', 'El Greco']","['Mona Lisa', 'The Last Supper', 'The Creation of Adam', 'School of Athens', 'The Birth of Venus', 'The Arnolfini Portrait', 'David', 'The Tempest', 'The Last Judgment', 'The Annunciation']",Renaissance
1,"Baroque art emerged in Europe around the early 17th century, during a time of significant religious and political transformation. The Catholic Church sought to counter the Spread of Protestant Reformation through the Counter-Reformation, commissioning opulent and emotionally engaging artworks designed to inspire devotion and awe. Politically, absolute monarchies, such as those of France and Spain, used the grandeur of Baroque art to convey power and control. Culturally, the period was marked by a fascination with humanism and scientific discovery, challenging artists to pursue realism and explore dynamic compositions.",1600 to 1750,"Baroque art is characterized by dramatic use of light and shadow, known as chiaroscuro, which creates intense contrasts and enhances emotional impact. Dynamic movement is a hallmark, achieved through the portrayal of swirling, energetic forms and the use of diagonal lines. Baroque art often engages viewers' senses and emotions, depicting scenes of intense drama and exuberance. The use of rich, vibrant colors and lavish ornamentation reflects the era's grandeur. Baroque artists were adept at depicting both sacred and secular themes, and their works often included symbolic, complex narratives designed to captivate and inform audiences.","['Caravaggio', 'Peter Paul Rubens', 'Rembrandt van Rijn', 'Gian Lorenzo Bernini', 'Diego Velázquez', 'Artemisia Gentileschi', 'Frans Hals', 'Nicolas Poussin', 'Johannes Vermeer', 'Anthony van Dyck']","['The Calling of St. Matthew', 'The Elevation of the Cross', 'The Night Watch', 'Las Meninas', 'Judith Slaying Holofernes', 'The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa', 'Woman Holding a Balance', 'Self-Portrait with Two Circles', 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp', 'The Triumph of Bacchus']",Baroque
2,"The Rococo movement emerged in early 18th-century France, succeeding the grandeur of the Baroque period. Its development coincided with the decline of Louis XIV's stringent regime, reflecting a shift towards playful elegance and lighthearted indulgence. The movement coincided with the Enlightenment, a time of intellectual flourishing which promoted individualism and a questioning of authority. Socially, the rise of the middle class influenced Rococo's intimate and personal style, contrasting the religious and formal subjects of Baroque art. Culturally, the movement is closely tied to the court of Louis XV and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, who were prominent patrons. As Rococo spread across Europe, it adapted to local tastes, becoming less ornate outside of France. It primarily catered to the tastes of the aristocracy, embracing themes of love, nature, and whimsicality, in tune with the elite's desire for escapism and leisure over the sociopolitical turbulence of the era.",1720 to 1780,"Rococo art is characterized by its ornate and decorative style, emphasizing pastel colors, asymmetrical designs, and light-hearted themes. It often features playful and witty subjects, such as romantic dalliances, mythological scenes, and pastoral idylls, celebrating the pleasures of life. The movement preferred intimate settings, capturing the refinement of domestic interiors rather than grandiosity. Technically, Rococo artists utilized intricate brushwork to achieve soft contours and a sense of fluidity, enhanced by light color palettes that balanced luminosity with shading techniques. Philosophically, Rococo art reflected Enlightenment ideals by exploring the sensual and quotidian joys of life, in contrast to the heavy themes of Baroque art. The movement's decorative flourishes extended beyond paintings into architecture and design, with ornate furniture, elaborate candelabras, and curved lines, all contributing to its holistic aesthetic.","['Jean-Honoré Fragonard', 'François Boucher', 'Antoine Watteau', 'Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin', 'François Lemoyne']","['The Swing', 'The Triumph of Venus', 'Embarkation for Cythera', 'Soap Bubbles', 'Hercules and Omphale']",Rococo
3,"Neoclassicism emerged in the mid-18th century as a reaction against the ornate Rococo style that dominated Europe. It was heavily influenced by Enlightenment ideals, which emphasized reason, order, and rationality. The movement reflected a renewed interest in the classical art and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome. This revival was partly stimulated by the discovery of archaeological sites such as Pompeii and Herculaneum, which fueled the fascination with antiquity. The political climate also played a significant role; the American and French Revolutions called for a return to democratic ideals, mirrored in Neoclassical art's representations of civic virtue and moral clarity. The movement became a visual embodiment of political and social ideals in an era characterized by dramatic shifts in governance and philosophy. Neoclassicism spread rapidly in Europe and America, influencing everything from painting to architecture and literature, shaping the cultural landscape until the rise of Romanticism.",1760 to 1830,"Neoclassicism is defined by its use of classical subjects and themes, presenting idealized portrayals of figures from mythology and history. This style is characterized by clarity of form, sober colors, and strong compositional lines reflecting the rationality esteemed by classical antiquity. Artists employed symmetrical and balanced arrangements, often using perspective and chiaroscuro to achieve depth and three-dimensionality. The movement emphasized the importance of drawing over color, embodying a sense of harmony, proportion, and restrained emotion. Neoclassical artists aimed to inspire virtues such as courage, sacrifice, and patriotism. Their works often featured subjects set in Greco-Roman attire, highlighting symmetry and minimalistic backgrounds that focused attention on figures. Techniques involved polished surfaces and stringent adherence to anatomical correctness, as artists sought to emulate the ideals and techniques of classical art.","['Jacques-Louis David', 'Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres', 'Anton Raphael Mengs', 'Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun', 'Angelica Kauffman']","['Oath of the Horatii', 'The Death of Marat', 'The Intervention of the Sabine Women', 'La Grande Odalisque', 'The Apotheosis of Homer']",Neoclassicism
4,"Romanticism emerged in the late 18th century as a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and the Industrial Revolution's focus on mechanization. It arose amidst political upheavals such as the American Revolution (1775-83), the French Revolution (1789-99), and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars, which fueled a desire for individual freedom and emotional expression. Culturally, Romanticism countered the rationality of Neoclassicism, valuing the individual's subjective experience and the beauty of nature. It sought to capture the sublime, where nature's vastness and power evoke emotions beyond human comprehension. This movement also emerged as a counter-discourse to industrialization's dehumanizing effects, glorifying the past and the medieval as idealized responses to contemporary societal issues.",1800 to 1850,"Romanticism is characterized by a focus on intense emotion, individualism, and the sublime. Artists emphasized the importance of feeling over rationality, often depicting dramatic scenes with dynamic compositions and vibrant color palettes. The movement celebrated nature's beauty and volatility, often portraying tempestuous landscapes, wild seascapes, and untamed wildernesses as reflections of human emotion and imagination. Romantic artists employed loose, expressive brushstrokes to capture movement and atmosphere, often emphasizing contrasts in light and shadow to heighten emotional impact. Additionally, themes of heroism, exoticism, and nationalism were prevalent, reflecting a fascination with the past and differing cultures.","['Caspar David Friedrich', 'J.M.W. Turner', 'Eugène Delacroix', 'Francisco Goya', 'John Constable', 'Théodore Géricault', 'William Blake', 'Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres', 'Thomas Cole', 'Philipp Otto Runge']","['Wanderer above the Sea of Fog', 'The Fighting Temeraire', 'Liberty Leading the People', 'The Third of May 1808', 'The Hay Wain', 'The Raft of the Medusa', 'The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun', 'The Death of Sardanapalus', 'Rain, Steam, and Speed', 'Moonrise by the Sea']",Romanticism
5,"Realism emerged in the mid-19th century as a reaction against the idealized aesthetic of Romanticism. The Industrial Revolution and the rise of the bourgeoisie influenced Realism's focus on ordinary life and society's transformations. As urbanization increased and significant social changes unfolded—partly due to the revolutions of 1848—there was a growing interest in democratic and egalitarian values. The movement sought to depict real and everyday subjects, which aligned with contemporary political and social movements that demanded truth and social justice. Gustave Courbet, a pioneer of Realism, famously declared that painting should represent real and existing things, reflecting society's drive for honesty and reform. The movement gained momentum with advancements in photography, which challenged artists to produce accurate representations of life. Realism also reflected scientific and intellectual progress, aligning with positivism's emphasis on observable reality and experience.",1848 to 1900,"Realism is characterized by its commitment to depicting subjects truthfully without idealization. Artists focused on ordinary people, daily life, and contemporary settings, often highlighting social issues. The style features detailed and precise imagery, with a focus on everyday scenes rather than romanticized or mythological subjects. Realist artists employed subdued color palettes and meticulous techniques to create lifelike textures and depth. The movement emphasized a sober representation of working-class and rural life, often with a critical view of society and current events. Realists rejected the artificiality of previous art styles, preferring to portray life as it was experienced at the time. This dedication to authenticity and the commonplace set the stage for subsequent art movements like Impressionism and Modernism, which further explored everyday subjects and settings.","['Gustave Courbet', 'Jean-François Millet', 'Honoré Daumier', 'Édouard Manet', 'Jules Breton', 'Ilya Repin', 'Winslow Homer']","['The Stone Breakers', 'A Burial at Ornans', 'The Gleaners', 'Olympia', 'Painting of a Donkey at an Auction']",Realism
6,"Impressionism emerged in France in the late 19th century, during a period of sweeping social, political, and cultural change. The movement coincided with the tail end of the Industrial Revolution, which brought significant technological advancements and urbanization. Parisians experienced the renovation of their city, resulting in vast boulevards and modernized infrastructure, celebrated in many Impressionist paintings. Politically, France was still recovering from the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) and grappling with the establishment of the Third Republic. Culturally, there was a growing interest in capturing contemporary life and an increasing rejection of the rigidities of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The rise of photography challenged painters to explore new representations of light and movement. Impressionism challenged traditional art paradigms by prioritizing personal sensations and experiences, often depicting fleeting moments of light and atmosphere.",1870 to 1890,"Impressionism is characterized by its use of small, thin brush strokes, open compositions, and an emphasis on depicting light in its changing qualities. Artists painted en plein air to capture the momentary effects of sunlight, often focusing on scenes of modern life, landscapes, and urban settings. The movement embraced spontaneity and sought to convey the 'impression' of a scene rather than detailed realism. Impressionists utilized a lighter palette and often applied paint in unmixed colors directly onto the canvas to allow optical blending. This technique enabled them to achieve a vibrant, shimmering effect. The movement was also notable for its rejection of traditional perspectives, opting for unusual visual angles and compositions that conveyed a more dynamic and immediate experience.","['Claude Monet', 'Pierre-Auguste Renoir', 'Edgar Degas', 'Camille Pissarro', 'Édouard Manet', 'Alfred Sisley', 'Berthe Morisot', 'Mary Cassatt', 'Gustave Caillebotte', 'Frédéric Bazille']","['Impression, Sunrise', 'Luncheon of the Boating Party', 'Ballet Rehearsal', 'Woman with a Parasol', 'Rouen Cathedral Series', 'The Dance Class', 'The Luncheon on the Grass', 'The Boulevard Montmartre at Night', 'The Cradle', 'The Boating Party']",Impressionism
7,"Post-Impressionism emerged in the late 19th century as a reaction against the limitations of Impressionism. Originating in France, the movement was influenced by a desire for greater emotional depth and symbolic content than the Impressionists provided. While Impressionism focused on capturing fleeting moments and the effects of light, Post-Impressionists aimed to imbue their works with more structure, often employing vibrant colors and distinct forms. The movement coincided with a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization, which prompted a shift in artistic focus towards the expression of subconscious realities and spiritual themes. Additionally, the exploration of non-Western art by some artists, such as Japanese prints and African masks, broadened their visual vocabulary, challenging conventional representation and inspiring more abstract works. Ultimately, Post-Impressionism laid the groundwork for diverse avant-garde movements of the 20th century, including Fauvism and Cubism.",1886 to 1905,"Post-Impressionism is characterized by a focus on symbolic and emotional content beyond naturalistic representation. Unlike Impressionism, which prioritized light and momentary effects, Post-Impressionism explores structural composition and symbolic meaning. Key visual elements of the movement include bold, sometimes arbitrary colors, and exaggerated forms. Artists employed diverse techniques like pointillism, seen in Seurat's works, and expressive, swirling brushstrokes, characteristic of Van Gogh. The movement is marked by its philosophical approach to canvases as expressions of the artist's inner vision rather than mere depictions of the external world. This often involved personal symbolism, as in the work of Paul Gauguin, who used color to convey spiritual and emotional resonance. Furthermore, a departure from traditional Western perspective and modeling is evident, contributing to more abstract interpretations.","['Paul Cézanne', 'Vincent van Gogh', 'Georges Seurat', 'Paul Gauguin', 'Henri Rousseau']","['Mont Sainte-Victoire', 'The Starry Night', 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte', 'Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?', 'The Sleeping Gypsy']",Post-Impressionism
8,"Expressionism emerged in the early 20th century, primarily as a reaction to the dehumanizing aspects of industrialization and the horrors experienced during World War I. Originating in Germany, the movement represented a challenge to earlier Impressionism, rejecting its focus on naturalistic rendering. The sociopolitical upheaval, including the rise of urbanization, capitalism, and the onset of global conflicts, deeply influenced Expressionists who sought to express emotional experiences rather than external realities. The cultural ethos of the time was marked by anxiety, disillusionment, and a search for authenticity amidst societal mechanization and moral decline. These factors contributed to Expressionism's focus on subjective perspective and emotional intensity, providing a stark commentary on contemporary life and the human condition.",1905 to 1925,"Expressionism is characterized by its emphasis on representing emotions and subjective experiences rather than aiming for realistic depictions. Artists used exaggerated forms, distorted figures, and vivid, often shocking colors to convey emotional states. The techniques often included strong, bold brushstroke application, skewed perspectives, and a preference for portraying inner turmoil and existential angst. Subject matter frequently involved themes of isolation, trauma, and anxiety, reflecting the turbulent times. Philosophically, it was influenced by existentialist thought and a reaction against the strictures of academic art, allowing for free expression and creativity. Emotional depth and personal vision took precedence over detailed representation, creating artworks that were intense, dramatic, and often unsettling.","['Edvard Munch', 'Egon Schiele', 'Wassily Kandinsky', 'Ernst Ludwig Kirchner', 'Franz Marc', 'Oskar Kokoschka', 'Max Beckmann', 'Emil Nolde', 'August Macke', 'Karl Schmidt-Rottluff']","['The Scream', 'The Bride of the Wind', 'Composition VII', 'The Assassination', 'The Large Blue Horses', 'Self-Portrait with Physalis', 'Street, Berlin', 'The Last Supper', 'Cows, Yellow-Red-Green', 'The Blue Rider']",Expressionism
9,"Cubism emerged in the early 20th century as a revolutionary art movement led primarily by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Its development coincided with rapid changes in technology, urbanization, and a growing interest in concurrent scientific discoveries, such as Einstein's theory of relativity. The movement was influenced by a desire to break away from traditional perspectives and representational art forms. The intellectual climate of the time was heavily influenced by a questioning of previously held perceptions in both art and society. Artists sought new ways to reflect the complexities of modern life, spurred on by influences from non-Western art, particularly African masks and sculptures, which they perceived as more primal and direct in expression.",1907 to 1920,"Cubism is marked by its radical departure from traditional perspectives and representation. One of its main characteristics is the fragmentation of objects into geometric shapes and the use of multiple, overlapping perspectives to convey three-dimensionality on a flat surface. The movement can be divided into two main phases: Analytical Cubism, characterized by a monochromatic palette and fragmented objects, and Synthetic Cubism, characterized by brighter colors, simpler shapes, and the introduction of mixed media and collage techniques. Cubists often challenged conventional forms by deconstructing and reassembling subjects to depict them from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, pursuing an abstract representation over literal accuracy.","['Pablo Picasso', 'Georges Braque', 'Juan Gris', 'Fernand Léger', 'Robert Delaunay']","[""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"", 'Ma Jolie', 'The Portuguese', 'Woman with a Mandolin', 'Still Life with Chair Caning']",Cubism
10,"Surrealism emerged in the early 20th century as a response to the horrors of World War I and the disillusionment with traditional values. It was heavily influenced by the Dada movement, which rejected the rationalism and logic of the bourgeoisie culture. Furthermore, Surrealism drew from the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud, exploring the unconscious mind, dreams, and the irrational as sources of artistic inspiration. The movement sought to challenge established norms and conventions, both in art and in society, advocating for a liberation of the human spirit through the exploration of dreams and the unconscious. The cultural climate of the 1920s and 30s, characterized by rapid industrialization, political instability, and a fascination with the occult, provided fertile ground for Surrealists to critique reality and experiment with new modes of expression.",1924 to 1966,"Surrealism is characterized by its focus on the exploration of the unconscious mind, dreams, and irrational juxtapositions. Artists aimed to transcend the boundaries of reality and tap into the hidden recesses of the human psyche. This movement embraced dream-like scenes, bizarre imagery, and unexpected combinations of objects to create unsettling and fantastical worlds. Surrealists often employed techniques such as automatism, allowing the unconscious mind to guide the creation process without rational interference. They utilized precise, realistic styles to render fantastical scenes convincingly, drawing viewers into a distorted reality. The use of dream analysis, free association, and depictions of fantastical landscapes and illogical narratives are hallmark traits of Surrealist art, challenging conventional perceptions and inviting introspection.","['Salvador Dalí', 'René Magritte', 'Max Ernst', 'Joan Miró', 'André Breton', 'Giorgio de Chirico', 'Yves Tanguy', 'Frida Kahlo', 'Leonora Carrington', 'Remedios Varo']","['The Persistence of Memory', 'The Elephants', 'The Son of Man', 'Time Transfixed', 'The Lovers', 'The Eleventh Finger', 'Carnival of Harlequin', 'The Lovers II', 'Autumn Cannibalism', 'Archangel']",Surrealism
11,"Abstract Expressionism emerged in the United States in the post-World War II era, primarily during the late 1940s and 1950s. This movement was born in a period marked by political and social upheaval, including the aftermath of World War II, the Cold War's onset, and growing American cultural influence. The movement represented a shift of the epicenter of the art world from Paris to New York. During this time, artists sought to express profound human emotions and universal themes through non-representational forms. Influenced by Surrealism's focus on the unconscious and ideas about the sublimity of nature and human experience, these artists reacted against the traditional European art standards, emphasizing individual freedom and spontaneous, subjective expression. Additionally, Abstract Expressionism was influenced by the existentialist focus on the irrational and chaotic aspects of life and the desire to break from narrative and figuration.",1940 to 1960,"Abstract Expressionism is characterized by its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. It featured large-scale works that aimed to express the artist's profound emotions and individuality. Two main sub-styles included Action Painting, associated with dynamic, gestural brushstrokes and an emphasis on the physical act of painting itself, and Color Field Painting, emphasizing large fields of flat, solid color. Techniques often included dripping, dripping, smearing, and applying paint in a variety of ways to create textures and evoke a sense of raw emotion. The artists focused more on the process than the final product, and their work was often seen as an encounter between the artist and canvas rather than a depiction of reality. The movement rejected traditional aesthetics and embraced ambiguity, creating images that encouraged viewers to explore their own emotional responses.","['Jackson Pollock', 'Mark Rothko', 'Willem de Kooning', 'Franz Kline', 'Barnett Newman', 'Clyfford Still', 'Robert Motherwell', 'Ad Reinhardt', 'Lee Krasner', 'Joan Mitchell']","['No. 5, 1948', 'No. 61 (Rust and Blue)', 'Woman I', 'Excavation', 'Vir Heroicus Sublimis', 'Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110', 'Onement VI', 'Large Orange and Black', 'Blue and Black', 'Untitled (1956)']",Abstract Expressionism
12,"Pop Art emerged in the mid-20th century, primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom, as a reaction to the preceding art movements such as Abstract Expressionism, which were considered elitist by many. The movement developed in a context of post-war economic boom, marked by consumerism, mass media, and pop culture. This era was characterized by the proliferation of advertising, the rise in production of consumer goods, and the influence of television and cinema, which deeply impacted societal values and norms. As such, Pop Art can be seen as both a celebration and critique of the material abundance and mass production of this era, blurring the boundaries between 'high' art and commercial art.",1950 to 1970,"Pop Art is known for its bold, vibrant colors and the appropriation of imagery from mass culture, including advertising, comic strips, and mundane cultural objects. Artists often employed techniques such as silkscreen printing, which allowed for the mass production of artworks in a manner akin to the mass production of consumer goods. This movement favored clear lines, sharp forms, and recognizable iconography, often incorporating elements of irony and parody. The subject matter was often derived from mass media and popular culture, reflecting and critiquing the perceived superficiality and banality of these sources. Pop Art challenged traditional boundaries of art, questioning its role and function in society, and democratized art to be more accessible to the public.","['Andy Warhol', 'Roy Lichtenstein', 'Claes Oldenburg', 'James Rosenquist', 'Richard Hamilton']","['Marilyn Diptych', 'Whaam!', 'I was a Rich Man’s Plaything', 'Three Flags', 'Electric Chair Series']",Pop Art
13,"Contemporary Art emerged in the post-World War II era, developing amid rapid technological advances, global political shifts, and cultural transformations. Reflecting a diverse, global perspective, it engages with issues like identity, globalization, and technological integration. The movement addresses diverse social issues defined by the Civil Rights Movement, gender equality struggles, and post-colonial discourse. Technological advancements have influenced its adaptive nature, shifting artistic evaluation and production methods. Furthermore, postmodern influences challenge traditional definitions of art, questioning authorial intent and blurring the boundaries between high and low culture. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw artists tapping into multimedia, digital technologies, and global dialogues, altering both the form and intent of art creation.",1960 to Present,"Contemporary Art is characterized by its diversity and eclectic nature, often marked by an experimental approach to mediums and a conceptual focus. Artists in this movement frequently employ multimedia, including digital, video, and installation art, reflecting an embrace of technology. Thematically, it explores complex global issues such as identity, culture, and politics, often incorporating elements of activism. Flexibility in interpretation and context-oriented works are pivotal, pushing viewers to consider broader societal implications rather than aesthetic appeal alone. Tools and techniques vary widely, integrating everyday objects, digital fabrication, and interactive elements that encourage viewer participation. This movement's defining trait is its lack of uniformity; it evolves with the times, reflecting the ongoing changes and challenges of contemporary society.","['Jeff Koons', 'Yayoi Kusama', 'Damien Hirst', 'Ai Weiwei', 'Cindy Sherman', 'Gerhard Richter', 'Tracey Emin', 'Jean-Michel Basquiat', 'Takashi Murakami', 'Banksy']","['Balloon Dog (Orange)', 'In Infinity', 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living', 'Sunflower Seeds', 'Untitled Film Still #21', 'Betty', 'My Bed', 'Untitled', 'Tan Tan Bo', 'Girl with Balloon']",Contemporary Art
14,"Fauvism emerged in the early 20th century, largely in France, at a time of artistic exploration and rapid social change. Influenced by Post-Impressionism and Symbolism, it reacted against the detailed realism of the previous era. Marked by vibrant color and audacious brushwork, Fauvism aligns with broader modernist trends and the bohemian lifestyle of avant-garde Paris, rejecting industrialization's effects and embracing a liberated emotional expression. The Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris, as well as increasing interest in non-Western art, also contributed to an atmosphere ripe for breaking away from tradition, making way for bold artistic revolutions.",1905 to 1908,"Fauvism is characterized by its radical use of color, with painters employing pure, intense hues directly from the tube. It broke with traditional representational techniques, opting for simplified forms and exaggerated perspectives to emphasize emotional impact. Artists favored spontaneous, painterly strokes, creating vibrant surfaces that prioritize expression over realistic depiction. Unlike their Impressionist predecessors, Fauves de-emphasized detail and light, focusing instead on color as an autonomous element representing inner moods. Landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits were common subjects, but the movement was distinctly defined not by subject matter but by its technique and objectives. Fauvism laid groundwork for future abstract and expressionist movements by prioritizing emotional depth over visual accuracy.","['Henri Matisse', 'André Derain', 'Maurice de Vlaminck', 'Raoul Dufy', 'Georges Braque']","['Woman with a Hat', 'Charing Cross Bridge, London', 'The Dessert: Harmony in Red', 'The River Seine at Chatou', 'The Green Stripe (Portrait of Madame Matisse)']",Fauvism
